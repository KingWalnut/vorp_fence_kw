Black Market Items Buyer/seller (fence)

=================================================

Installation :

Editted version of vorp_fence to support buy function from the shop as well. Credits to everyone else.

=================================================

This is heavily based on the beautiful Nerakhon's and Blue's bwrp_animalshelter script menu and location system, I added all the Fence Vendors locations and options to sell stuff there

Usage :

Go to a fence vendor location on the map, press (E) to open menu, select items to sell or G to buy.
You can modify items and prices in config.lua
